# Computer Space 1971 (Remixed in Unity)

🄲🄾🄼🄿🅄🅃🄴🅁 🅂🄿🄰🄲🄴


This is a project made by me: https://youtube.com/c/funmastered

It's a remix of computer space where I add a difficulty curve and test out how fast I could remake this game in modern day technology.

Computer Space is the worlds first arcade game that was commercially sold, and no-ones remade it so far, so here it is.

Builds included in the BuildsWin Folder and the project files in the assets. Unity 2020.2.6f for the exact version although anything about 2018 would work.
